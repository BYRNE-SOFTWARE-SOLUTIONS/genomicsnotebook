    "Bioconductor provides tools for the analysis and comprehension of high-throughput genomic data. Bioconductor uses the R statistical programming language, and is open source and open development. It has two releases each year, and an active user community. We're now offering a mirror of the official `Bioconductor` docker image on Microsoft Container Registry. This image can also be used as a base for your own custom genomics related docker images.\n",
