# NVIDIA Clara Parabricks on Microsoft Azure 

<!-- #region -->

`NVIDIA_Clara_Parabricks_on_Azure.ipnyb` presents the **sample code** of NVIDIA Clara Parabricks pipeline on Azure Machine Learning Studio and Ubuntu Virtual Machines on [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/)

### What is NVIDIA Clara Parabricks Pipelines?*
"_Parabricks is a software suite for performing secondary analysis of next generation sequencing (NGS) DNA and RNA data. A major benefit of Parabricks is that it is designed to deliver results at blazing fast speeds and low cost. Parabricks can analyze whole human genomes in about **45 minutes**, compared to about 30 hours for **30x WGS data**. The best part is the output results exactly match the commonly used software. So, itâ€™s fairly simple to verify the accuracy of the output._"

### Why use NVIDIA Clara Parabricks Pipelines?*

"_Under the hood, it achieves this performance through tight integration with GPUs, which excel at performing data parallel computation much more effectively than traditional CPU-based solutions. Parabricks was built from the ground up by GPU computing and Deep Learning experts who wanted to develop the fastest and most efficient possible implementation of common genomics algorithms used in secondary analysis._"
